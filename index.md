### Artefacts

*   Units 1-3

    Discussion Forum 1

    During these units, a discussion over the reasons that have led to the rise of agent-based systems and the benefits that this approach can offer to organisations took place. In the link below evidence of this discussion can be seen.

*   Units 5-7
  
    Discussion Forum 2

    During these units, a discussion over the potential advantages and disadvantages of the use of agent communication languages such as KQML as well as over how do they compare with method invocation in Python or Java took place. In the link below evidence of this discussion can be seen.

*   Unit 6
  
    Working Together

    In this unit, it was learnt how to use KQML and KIF to design communications between agents, we discussed the strengths and weaknesses of agent communications languages, and evaluated the different approaches to agent communication. During this unit it was also finanlised the team project assisgnment, where as a team we had to develop a comprehensive design proposal report for the development of an Academic Research Online Agent. In the links below, evidence of relevant activities can be seen.

*   Unit 8

    Understanding Natural Language Processing
  
    In this unit, NLP in action was explored, key elements of using a Word2Vec model was learnt, and the use of constituency-based parse trees was investigated. In the links below, evidence of practising the creation of constituency-based parse trees can be seen.

*   Units 9-11
  
    Discussion Forum 3

    During these units, a discussion over the ethical concerns of the new technologies supported by Deep Learning models that are possible to generate ‘new’ content, took place. In the link below evidence of this discussion can be seen.

*   Unit 10
  
    Deep Learning in Action

    In this unit, emerging applications of deep learning were presented, the potential social and ethical issues associated with these technologies were discussed, and the future directions of these technologies were explored. In the link below, an overview of self-driving cars, a brief synopsis of how they work, and their potential impacts in terms of ethics, privacy, social good, or any other socio-technical aspects can be seen.

*   Unit 11

    Intelligent Agents in Action

    In this unit, the concept of Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing was introduced, the concept of a smart shop floor and the associated issues were discussed, and the the use of agent-based modelling in the financial sector was investigated. During this unit an Academic Research Online Agent was developed based on the design reported prepared during Unit 6. In the links below, the presentation summarizing the development of the agent as well as the transcript of the presentation can be seen.

*   Unit 12
  
    The Future of Intelligent Agents

    During this unit, the future directions of intelligent technologies were explored, the potential ramifications of these developments were discussed, and how technology will evolve in the coming years was considered.
